# Reportnet 3 (eea.reportnet)
This FME Package contains the Reportnet 3 Reader introduced for FME 2021.

Reportnet 3 is the new [e-Reporting platform](https://reportnet.europa.eu) for reporting environmental and climate data to the European Environment Agency (EEA). The platform embraces the strategic goals of the European Commission's Green Deal and Digital Strategy and will host reporting tasks on behalf of EEA and the Commission.

## Usage
The Reportnet 3 Reader uses a Reportnet 3 Web Connection. The connection should be configured with a Dataflow ID and API-key from the e-Reporting platform.

When this is configured the user may browse the Datasets the API-key grants access to.

FME Feature Types are defined by selecting the corresponding Reportnet 3 Tables.
