The 1.0.1 update is a minor documentation improvement.

We recommend to install it from [FME Hub](https://hub.safe.com/publishers/eea).

If, for some reason, that is not possible, you can also download the package from here:

[https://github.com/eea/eea.reportnet3.api.fme/releases/tag/v1.0.1](https://github.com/eea/eea.reportnet3.api.fme/releases/tag/v1.0.1)

Please report any issues to [discomap@eea.europa.eu](mailto:discomap@eea.europa.eu?subject=Reportnet3%20FME%20Package).
