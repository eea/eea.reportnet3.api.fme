Two new format attributes were added:

- `reportnet_id_table_schema` - Id of the table schema
- `reportnet_id_record` - Id of the record

We recommend to install it from [FME Hub](https://hub.safe.com/publishers/eea).

If, for some reason, that is not possible, you can also download the package from here:

[https://github.com/eea/eea.reportnet3.api.fme/releases/tag/v1.1.0](https://github.com/eea/eea.reportnet3.api.fme/releases/tag/v1.1.0)
