Fix bug with v3 connection string. Also add usage notes for v3 connection string in [docs](https://eea.github.io/eea.reportnet3.api.fme/assets/documentation/help/reportnet3connectionstring.html).

We recommend to install it from [FME Hub](https://hub.safe.com/publishers/eea).

If, for some reason, that is not possible, you can also download the package from here:

[https://github.com/eea/eea.reportnet3.api.fme/releases/tag/v1.2.0](https://github.com/eea/eea.reportnet3.api.fme/releases/tag/v1.2.0)

Please report any issues to [discomap@eea.europa.eu](mailto:discomap@eea.europa.eu?subject=Reportnet3%20FME%20Package).
